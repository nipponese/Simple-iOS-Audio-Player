# Simple iOS AVAudioPlayer Usage

This is the most basic implementation of AVAudioPlayer I could conjure.

## Usage

1. Assuming you just started a new project, copy all the crap from `SimpleAudioPlayer.swift` into `ViewController.swift`
2. Create your `Play`, `Stop` and `Pause` buttons in your Storyboard (I am assuming you know auto layout here).
3. Hook up your buttons to the Outlets and Actions.
4. Add an audio file to your project (Make sure you use the `Add files to...` command, don't just drop it in!)
5. Run the thing.
